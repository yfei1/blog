> The percentage of active managers outperformed by the index has increased over time.

Criticism #1: Could it be possible that if everyone invested only in index funds, indexing could grow so large that stocks could become massively mispriced?
If everybody indexed, who would ensure that stock prices reflect all the information available about the prospects for different companies? The paradox of index investing is that the stock market needs some active traders who analyze and act on new information so that stocks are efficiently priced and sufficiently liquid for investors to be able to buy and sell.

> Suppose everyone did index and individual stocks did not reflect new information, in a free-market system we can expect that advantageous arbitrage opportunities are exploited by profit-seeking market participants no matter how many investors index. In addition, the percentage of active managers outperformed by the inndex has increased over time shows the market is becoming more efficient despite the growth of indexing.

Criticism #2: Index investing has produced an unhealthy concentration of ownership that has not been seen - common ownership of companies in the same industry - reduce the incentive to compete, may produce unwanted anti-competitive effects and invites remedies to prevent losses for the economy as a whole. If one is the largest shareholder of all the airline companies, that manager will be loath to see vigorou fare competition that would reduce the profit margins of all the companies in the industry - lead to ticket prices being 3-5% higher than they would be under separate ownership.

> Perhaps banding together to encourage the airline companies to raise their prices would benefit their holdings of airline stocks, but this would mean higher costs for all the other companies in their portfolio that depend on the airlines to facilitate business travel. Indeed, since index funds have encouraged managements to adopt compensation systems based on relative rather than absolute performance, they have explicitly promoted vigorous competition among the firms in every industry.

Vanguard's differentiator:
> The only way for the 100 million families whom the mutual fund industry serves to maximize their share of the financial-market returns they earn as a group is by minimizing their costs.

Key metrics:
> Managing $5 trillion on behalf of some 20 million clients worldwide, with 65% share of the industry's entire net cash flow during the past five years - more than two largest competitors combined. General publics invest $1 billion each business day into Vanguard.
