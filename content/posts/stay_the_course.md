The story of Vanguard and the Index Revolution

<!--more-->

TODO: Verify it still holds

> The percentage of active managers outperformed by the index has increased over time.

Criticism #1: Could it be possible that if everyone invested only in index funds, indexing could grow so large that stocks could become massively mispriced?
If everybody indexed, who would ensure that stock prices reflect all the information available about the prospects for different companies? The paradox of index investing is that the stock market needs some active traders who analyze and act on new information so that stocks are efficiently priced and sufficiently liquid for investors to be able to buy and sell.

> Suppose everyone did index and individual stocks did not reflect new information, in a free-market system we can expect that advantageous arbitrage opportunities are exploited by profit-seeking market participants no matter how many investors index. In addition, the percentage of active managers outperformed by the inndex has increased over time shows the market is becoming more efficient despite the growth of indexing.

Criticism #2: Index investing has produced an unhealthy concentration of ownership that has not been seen - common ownership of companies in the same industry - reduce the incentive to compete, may produce unwanted anti-competitive effects and invites remedies to prevent losses for the economy as a whole. If one is the largest shareholder of all the airline companies, that manager will be loath to see vigorou fare competition that would reduce the profit margins of all the companies in the industry - lead to ticket prices being 3-5% higher than they would be under separate ownership.

> Perhaps banding together to encourage the airline companies to raise their prices would benefit their holdings of airline stocks, but this would mean higher costs for all the other companies in their portfolio that depend on the airlines to facilitate business travel. Indeed, since index funds have encouraged managements to adopt compensation systems based on relative rather than absolute performance, they have explicitly promoted vigorous competition among the firms in every industry.

Vanguard's differentiator:
> The only way for the 100 million families whom the mutual fund industry serves to maximize their share of the financial-market returns they earn as a group is by minimizing their costs.

Key metrics:
> Managing $5 trillion on behalf of some 20 million clients worldwide, with 65% share of the industry's entire net cash flow during the past five years - more than two largest competitors combined. General publics invest $1 billion each business day into Vanguard.

John's thesis key conclusion:
> Investment companies should be operated in the most efficient, honest, and economical way possible.

> Future growth can be maximized by reducing sales charges and management fees.

> Funds can make no claims to superiority over the market averages indexes.

> The principal activity of investment companies is the management of their investment portfolios. Everything else is incidental.

The Conflicts of Fiduciary Duty. The general investment management companies had a fiduciary duty both to the mutual fund shareholders AND to the management shareholders. But when a privately held management company becomes publicly held, this conflict of interest is exacerbated.

To serve the management shareholders, the managers need to expose high expense ratio over their funds, while to serve the mutual funds shareholders, the managers need to lower their expense ratio over those funds:

> Most of the mistakes and major faults of the financial era that has just drawn to a close will be ascribed to the failure to observe the fiduciary principle, the precept as old as holy writ, that "a man cannot serve two masters". Those who sereve nominally as trustees but consider only last the interests of those whose funds they command suggest how far we have ignored the necessary implications of that principle.

Two potential ways to resolve this conflict:

> A mutualization, whereby the funds acquire the management company... or internalization, whereby the active executives own the management company, with contracts negotiated on a 'cost-plus' basis, with incentives for both performance and efficiency, but without the ability to capitalize earnings through public sale.

> It was high time, I added, that any conflicts between the profession of investing and the businees of investing be reconciled in favor of the client.
> 我补充说，现在是时候调节专业投资和投资业务之间的矛盾以使客户满意了。

Mutual fund activities are divided into three categories: Administration, Investment management and share distribution. Vanguard starts from a small step - internalizing administration by fund staff.
